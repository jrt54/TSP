Upper Bound Algorithms: (Greedy) Nearest Neighbor, 2Opt, 3Opt, 2/3Opt

Description of files:
GNN.py : finds nearest neighbor TSP solution from a specified starting node
enhance.py : performs 2Opt and 3Opt on a provided TSP solution
getTSP_UB.py : calls GNN and determines which enhancement scheme should be used
UpperBound.py : user interface; reads in .txt file, makes node-node adjacency matrix, and prints solution

Usage:
$ python UpperBound.py '<file name>' e

<file name> : name of file, in format specified by project
e : an integer, either 0, 2, 3, or 23:
	0  : runs GNN; no enhancement algorithm
	2  : performs 2Opt on GNN solution
	3  : performs 3Opt on GNN solution
	23 : perofrms 2Opt on GNN solution, and then 3Opt on 2Opt's solution

Output:
Displays edges and weights in optimal TSP path, as per project description
Also outputs time elapsed, and the number of enhancement moves made for the optimal solution
